# No_show_project

## Overview
This project is a part of the core content for the ALX-Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Program.

## Dataset
The dataset shows information from 100thousand medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 

## Investigation
The following questions were answered through the analysis:
- Which gender is more likely to show up for appointments?
- What are the top five locations where patients are more likely to show up for their appointments?
- Is sending messages likely to affect if a patient shows up or not?
- which category of patients who are on scholarship are more likely to miss their appointments?

Four issues were detected and cleaned before visualization.

## Conclusions
The report shows that the following patients are more likely to show up for their appointment:

- females
- those that live in those that live in Jardim Camburi, Maria Oritz, Resistencia, Jardim Da Penha, Centro
- those that suffer from Hipertension are also more likely to miss their appointment than others.

However, considering the fact that the dataset contained more of patients who showed up for their appointment, it would have been clearer to analyse factors that could contribute to a patient missing his appointment if the dataset contained only those missed their appointment.
